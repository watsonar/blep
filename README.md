Blep is an interactive cat food database with regularly updated ingredient, macronutrient, and cost information for thousands of cat food products, made easily accessible through flexible and rapid filtering and sorting. Itâ€™s also the word for that thing your pet does when they close their mouth without pulling their tongue back in and it just kind of sticks out for a while.
